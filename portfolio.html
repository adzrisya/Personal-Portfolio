While waiting to further my degree, I have also mastered in baking and cooking.</font>
<br>
I llllllllooooooovvvvvvvveeeeee to cook! and I llllllllloooooooovvvvvvveeeeeeeee to eat too! hihi.<br>
I eat all types of food, western and "masakan kampung". I like to cook spicy food like "ayam masak hijau",<br>
"ayam masak merah" ummm everything that comes with "sambal" hihi. <br>
When my mother cook for lunch or dinner, I always watch and learn like how she prepare the foods. <br>
Aaaaaaannnnnnddddd when she's not around, she always ask me to cook any dishes that I know. <br>
Good or bad taste everyone must taste it :p I always watch "dapur bujang" or any cooking show on youtube. <br>
"Dapur bujang" is my favorite youtube channel! because the ingredient is so eeeeeessssssaaaaayyyyyyeeeehhhhh hihi <br>
I like to bake too! on weekend, when my aunty's have a lot of orders from customers,<br>
I went to her house to help her made any tradition "kuih', <br>
brownies, sandwiches and more! My sister also bake cakes, brownies and cream puff.<br>
but I am soOooOOooo lazy to clean up all the mess! <br>
Now I owned an online business called "thebakeriology" on instagram. Handling this business have thought me <br>
how to deal with customers, manage time to complete the order on time, design and decorating cakes.</font>
